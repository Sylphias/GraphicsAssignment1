## Notes on Bonuses
Although the surface color one asked me to change I didnt like the color that was generated based off the curvature (was a little flat)
![using curvature](images/UsingCurvature.PNG)

Instead I created another way to interpret the colors based on the magnitude of the K vector and changed their color based on the ratio of the direction the vector is pointing in which generates a really cool colorful effect instead.
